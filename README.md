This is a project that I implement in Python within the framework of Network Theory class that I attented.
The project concerns the design and implementation of an algorithm that uses the distance quality function for finding communities in networks. As data I used a network that contains 1005 nodes and 25571 edges and is directed! (in file data_sheets you will find the data).
